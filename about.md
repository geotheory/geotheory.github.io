title:  "About me"
---

I am a freelance data scientist with background in geographical information science, and a Masters graduate and former postgraduate researcher at UCL's [Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/).  I've previously also worked with [Medecins Sans Frontieres](https://www.msf.org.uk/) and volunteered with [Missing Maps](https://www.missingmaps.org/) [London](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-missing-maps-london-6862565027), though these days a small person gets most of my spare time.

This site continues the blog previously hosted at geotheory.co.uk.
