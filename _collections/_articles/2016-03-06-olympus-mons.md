The elevation data is from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), visualised here in 2.5D using simple lines – a technique used in 1970 by astronomer Harold Craft (later popularised on the cover of the Joy Division album Unknown Pleasures), but adding a colour scale to complement y-axis extrusion. The animation was created in R with ggplot2.
