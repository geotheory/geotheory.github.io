The Pew Research Center yesterday published their [2013 report](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/) on global trends in religious restrictions and hostilities. The study develops two indicators, the Government Restrictions Index (GRI) to reflect the legal/political aspects of religious freedom, and the Social Hostilities Index (SHI) to examine it at societal/community levels. GRI and SHI scores are [calculated for each country](https://web.archive.org/web/20180501080424/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2015/02/Restrictions2015_fullReport.pdf) from 17 frequently cited human rights reports published by UN bodies, select diplomatic services and NGOs.

The research is a valuable contribution to the debates about trends in Western/more-developed countries of religious freedoms and inter-cultural tensions in the wake of recent political events. To reduce the data a little in line with that debate, here are the scores for 2013 for just the OECD countries:

It's unsettling to see the UK’s poor score on social hostility, both in relative and absolute terms.
